# main.py — the FastAPI app entry point. uvicorn loads `app.main:app`.
#
# ⭐ START HERE: top-of-module calls `init_sentry()` FIRST (must run before
# the FastAPI object exists so the integration hooks in). Then we build a
# minimal `app` with a no-op lifespan. Health endpoints, real routes, and
# the rest of the middleware land in subsequent Day-2 PRs — this PR ships
# the skeleton + Sentry only.
#
# WHAT IS THE LIFESPAN HOOK?
# A FastAPI feature that runs code at startup and shutdown. Code before
# `yield` runs once when the first request arrives; code after `yield`
# runs once on SIGTERM. We use it for things like opening database pools
# (Day-2 PR 5) and closing them cleanly. Today it's a no-op placeholder
# so future PRs can fill it in without touching this file's structure.
#
# WHY ONE FastAPI INSTANCE, NOT A FACTORY?
# `uvicorn app.main:app` expects a module-level `app` variable, not a
# factory function. Keeping it module-level (not wrapped in get_app())
# matches the rest of the FastAPI ecosystem and avoids the "is this a
# function or an instance?" papercut.
