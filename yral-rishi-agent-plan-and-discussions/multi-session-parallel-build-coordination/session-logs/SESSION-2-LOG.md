## 2026-05-13 — Day 1, first commit (PR 1: pyproject + Dockerfile + .dockerignore)

**Branch:** `session-2/template-skeleton-pyproject-and-dockerfile`

**Files added (3):**
- `yral-rishi-agent-new-service-template/pyproject.toml` — Python 3.12 pin, hatchling build backend, runtime deps (fastapi 0.115.12, uvicorn[standard] 0.34.0, asyncpg 0.30.0, redis 5.2.1, httpx 0.28.1, pydantic 2.10.5, alembic 1.14.0), dev extras (pytest 8.3.4 + pytest-asyncio 0.25.2). All deps pinned ==.
- `yral-rishi-agent-new-service-template/Dockerfile` — two-stage build: stage 1 installs deps into /opt/venv via hatchling; stage 2 copies venv + app code into a slim Python 3.12 image, runs as non-root `appuser` UID 1001, CMD `uvicorn app.main:app`.
- `yral-rishi-agent-new-service-template/.dockerignore` — filters .git, __pycache__, .venv, editor crud, local .env files, docs/tests, compose files. Deliberately does NOT exclude Dockerfile/.dockerignore themselves (some builders need them in context).

**Decisions made (worth recording):**
- Hatchling chosen as build backend (over setuptools / poetry-core) — modern PEP 621 default, no plugin baggage, doesn't lock us into a specific CLI.
- Multi-stage Dockerfile uses the simplest pattern: copy `pyproject.toml + app/` once, run `pip install .` once. We forgo the more-elaborate "install deps in a separate layer for cache efficiency" trick — that optimization can come later if build time becomes a real complaint (A2.1: simple > clever).
- Dev extras include only `pytest` + `pytest-asyncio` for Day 1. Coverage tooling + ruff + pytest.ini land in Day 3 with the CI workflows (matches J1 ramp-up).
- Sentry SDK + Langfuse client deferred to Day 2 (added when their middleware files land — keeps Day 1 PR scope tight to "deps explicitly listed in role spec").
- Dockerfile references `app/main.py` (added Day 2). PR 1 alone won't `docker build` successfully — that's expected; PR description notes it. No CI yet (Day 3).

**B7 compliance:** every file carries the file-header block + section headers + role-comments-not-syntax + RELATED FILES footer. Voice matches existing `yral-rishi-hetzner-infra-template` for continuity.

**Constraints honored:**
- F12: Python 3.12 + asyncpg uniformly.
- F2: zero touches to `yral-rishi-hetzner-infra-template` (read patterns only).
- A2.1: kept things boring + simple; no clever optimizations.
- B7: full doc structure on every file (including pyproject.toml).
- D1/D8: no secrets in committed files; `.env.local` is in `.dockerignore`.

**Next:** PR 2 — docker-compose.yml + docker-compose.swarm.yml on branch `session-2/template-skeleton-compose`.
