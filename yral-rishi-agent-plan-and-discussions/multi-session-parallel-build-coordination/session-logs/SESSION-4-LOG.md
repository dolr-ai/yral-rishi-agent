## 2026-05-18 — MILESTONE: Session 4 first-launched by coordinator

### Action
Coordinator scaffolded Session 4's STATE + LOG files before Session 4's first work, per the agent definition's "initially scaffolded by coordinator on first launch" clause. Session 4 has completed Step A (first-launch onboarding context, 11 items) + Step B (I12 resume protocol, 6 steps) and is idle pending Rishi's `continue` to start Day 1.

Session 4 owns three services that together implement v2's conversation-turn business logic:
- yral-rishi-agent-conversation-turn-orchestrator (the LLM turn runner)
- yral-rishi-agent-soul-file-library (Soul File CRUD)
- yral-rishi-agent-influencer-and-profile-directory (catalog + Redis cache)

Day 1 task: spawn all three from Session 2's template via `new-service.sh` (one invocation per service, bundled into a single PR per A2.1 since they share shape).

### Files touched
- `yral-rishi-agent-plan-and-discussions/multi-session-parallel-build-coordination/session-state/SESSION-4-STATE.md` (new)
- `yral-rishi-agent-plan-and-discussions/multi-session-parallel-build-coordination/session-logs/SESSION-4-LOG.md` (new — this file)

### Why
Phase 1 launch readiness. State-hygiene lint requires SESSION-N-LOG.md to be updated on every session-N PR; scaffolding upfront means Session 4's first real PR appends to existing files (cleaner lint-passing path matching Sessions 1, 2, 5).

### Test evidence
N/A — meta-scaffolding, no functional change.

### Notes
- Session 4's agent definition: `.claude/agents/session-4-orchestrator.md`
- Codex reviewed Session 4's agent def across 4 rounds on PR #92 (8 total across both Session 3 + Session 4 agent defs); all real catches addressed before merge.
- Critical Codex catches that shaped the day-by-day plan:
  - Return shape: JSON MessageDto on v1 (parity), NOT SSE (would break A16). SSE only on /api/v2/* feature-flagged paths.
  - Safety stack (H5 prompt-injection + H4 crisis + A10 NSFW routing) wired Day 3 BEFORE any real LLM call — NOT deferred to Phase 2.
  - B4 product vocab: "Soul File" not "system prompt" in code/internal naming; only the API path keeps the legacy phrasing for chat-ai parity.
  - A14 STOP-and-ask before any live chat-ai read (Day 7 feature-parity sprint uses committed audit docs + contract fixtures by default).
- Session 3 launched in parallel; we coordinate via cross-session-dependencies.md.
- Hard-launch working target 2026-06-07 per Rishi's stated push date. **NOT a production cutover date** — cutover stays at Rishi's typed-YES discretion per A6.
