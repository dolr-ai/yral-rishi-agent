# Daily Log

## 2026-05-26 — Phase 0 + Phase 1 Days 2-14 (all in one session)

### What completed
- **Phase 0**: Archived 17 v2 service folders, removed 7 worktrees, closed PRs #147 and #157, deleted 130 stale branches, created CLAUDE.md + GLOSSARY.md + README.md, created CI workflows
- **Day 2**: config.py + database.py + auth.py + main.py + health routes (4 endpoints)
- **Day 3**: models.py + influencer READ endpoints + migrations (3 endpoints)
- **Day 4**: conversation routes + chat_v2 bot-aware inbox (6 endpoints)
- **Day 5**: ai_client (Gemini + OpenRouter) + send-message — the HEART (1 endpoint)
- **Day 6**: influencer CREATE flow — generate prompt, validate, create, update, delete, admin ban/unban (8 endpoints)
- **Day 7**: media upload + image generation in conversations (2 endpoints)
- **Day 8**: human-to-human chat — create, list, send message (3 endpoints)
- **Day 9**: unified inbox v3 — AI + human chats in one list (1 endpoint)
- **Day 10**: billing paywall — RESOLVED. Billing is 100% client-side. Mobile app calls `billing.yral.com/google/chat-access/check` directly. No backend code needed.
- **Day 11**: WebSocket inbox — real-time events (1 WS + 1 docs endpoint)
- **Day 12**: ETL script written + deploy scripts + project/servers config
- **Day 13**: DEPLOYED TO CLUSTER
  - Created `yral_agent_db` database on Patroni leader (rishi-5)
  - Applied both migrations (001_initial.sql, 002_influencer_trending_stats.sql)
  - Built Docker image on rishi-4 and rishi-5
  - Deployed as Swarm service `yral-rishi-agent` with 2 replicas
  - Updated internal Caddy config to route `agent.rishi.yral.com` → `yral-rishi-agent:8000`
  - All health checks passing through internal Caddy
- **Day 14**: 24 unit tests across 4 files

### Verified endpoints (via internal Caddy on rishi-5)
```
curl agent.rishi.yral.com/        → {"service":"Yral Agent API","version":"2.0.0","status":"running"}
curl agent.rishi.yral.com/health  → {"status":"OK","database":"reachable"}
curl agent.rishi.yral.com/status  → {"service":"Yral Agent API",...,"database":"reachable","gemini_model":"gemini-2.5-flash"}
curl agent.rishi.yral.com/api/v1/influencers → {"influencers":[],"total":0,"limit":50,"offset":0}
```

### Public URL status
`curl https://agent.rishi.yral.com/health` returns 503 — the rishi-1/2 edge Caddy needs a config reload to recognize the updated upstream on the v2 cluster. Internal Caddy on rishi-4/5 works perfectly.

**To fix:** Reload or redeploy the Caddy snippet on rishi-1/2 that proxies to the v2 cluster. The v2 internal Caddy is correctly routing to `yral-rishi-agent:8000`.

### Cluster state
- Swarm service: `yral-rishi-agent` — 2/2 replicas on rishi-4 + rishi-5
- Database: `yral_agent_db` on Patroni (leader: rishi-5, replicas: rishi-4, rishi-6)
- Old microservices still running (can be removed after cutover)

### Endpoint count
29 HTTP endpoints + 1 WebSocket = 30 total. All accounted for per the plan.

### Line count
- app/ code: 3,984 lines
- chat-ai baseline: 6,780 lines
- Ratio: 59% of chat-ai — same functionality, no bloat

## 2026-05-26 — Phase 2.1: Langfuse Tracing

### What completed
- Added `langfuse==2.60.2` to requirements
- Created `app/services/langfuse_tracing.py` — Langfuse client wrapper with `trace_generation()` helper
- Integrated tracing into `ai_client.generate_response()` — every Gemini and OpenRouter call is now traced with provider, model, input/output tokens, latency, user_id, conversation_id
- Error traces logged at ERROR level so failed LLM calls are visible in Langfuse
- Langfuse flush on app shutdown
- Config: `LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY`, `LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY`, `LANGFUSE_HOST` env vars (no-op if not set)

### To activate
Set LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY, LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY, and LANGFUSE_HOST env vars on the Swarm service. Can point to the self-hosted Langfuse on the cluster (once scaled up from 0 replicas) or Langfuse Cloud.

## 2026-05-26 — Phase 2.5: Request ID Tracing
- `app/middleware.py`: RequestIdMiddleware assigns UUID to every request, propagates to Sentry + response header

## 2026-05-26 — Phase 2.6: Redis WebSocket Pub/Sub
- Rewrote `app/services/websocket_manager.py` to publish all WS events via Redis pub/sub
- Background subscriber on each node delivers events to local WebSocket connections
- Falls back to local-only if Redis is not available (safe default)
- Added `redis==5.2.1` to requirements
- Subscriber started in main.py lifespan, cancelled on shutdown

## 2026-05-26 — Phase 2.2: LLM Client Abstraction
- Added `LlmResponse` frozen dataclass (content, provider, model, input_tokens, output_tokens, latency_ms, is_fallback)
- `generate_response()` returns `LlmResponse` instead of raw tuple
- Provider + model info preserved for observability

## 2026-05-26 — Phase 2.3: Soul File 4-Layer Composer
- `app/services/soul_file.py` — composes prompts from 4 layers:
  L1 (Global rules) → L2 (Archetype: companion/advisor/entertainer/educator/creator) → L3 (Per-influencer system_instructions) → L4 (Per-user memories)
- Deterministic output enables provider-side prompt caching
- Integrated into send-message flow

## 2026-05-26 — Phase 2.4: Enhanced Memory Extraction
- Structured categories: identity, preferences, goals, context, emotional
- Explicit-facts-only rule (no inferences from conversation)
- Concise values (under 50 chars)
- Correction-aware: user corrections override old memories

## 2026-05-26 — ETL: chat-ai → v2 data migration
- pg_dump from chat-ai DB on rishi-1 → load into yral_agent_db on rishi-5
- Influencers: 3,941 rows ✓
- Conversations: 284,763 rows ✓
- Messages: 3.3M rows (1.2GB dump, loading in progress)

## 2026-05-26 — Phase 3: Content Safety
- `app/services/content_safety.py` — three safety layers on every user message:
  1. Crisis detection: self-harm/suicide keywords → helpline response (India, US, intl)
  2. Prompt injection: regex patterns for jailbreak/DAN mode → blocked
  3. Adult content filter: NSFW keywords blocked for non-NSFW influencers
- Integrated into send-message flow: safety check before LLM call
- Crisis detection runs even for NSFW influencers (always)
- 14 new tests pass (8 content_safety + 6 soul_file)

## 2026-05-27 — Langfuse tracing fixed and operational
- Root cause: Redis auth (WRONGPASS) + Sentinel vs primary confusion + missing S3 creds
- Fix: pointed Langfuse at redis-primary:6379 with password, Hetzner S3 at fsn1.your-objectstorage.com
- Langfuse UI live at https://langfuse-agent.rishi.yral.com
- Traces flowing: status 207, all ingestion succeeding

## 2026-05-27 — Phase 4: Tiered User Memory
- `migrations/003_user_memories.sql` — user_memories table with category/key/value, per (user, influencer) pair
- `app/repositories/memory_repo.py` — upsert, get_for_user, get_all (influencer-specific + global)
- `app/services/memory.py` — extract_and_store() replaces old flat JSON approach, structured categories
- Send-message flow updated: reads from user_memories table, writes via background extraction
- pgvector not available on PG15 Spilo — designed for later upgrade (add embedding column)

## 2026-05-27 — Phase 5: Proactive Messages
- `migrations/004_proactive_messages.sql` — proactive_messages table (scheduling + delivery tracking)
- `app/services/proactive.py` — generate_proactive_message() uses influencer personality + user memories
- Trigger types: welcome_back (24h idle), follow_up, morning_greeting
- find_inactive_conversations() query for cron integration
- Delivery via existing push notification + WebSocket broadcast

## 2026-05-27 — Phase 6: First-Turn Nudge
- `app/services/nudge.py` — should_nudge() checks idle time + message count
- generate_nudge() creates personality-consistent follow-up for idle conversations
- Triggers: 5 min for 1-2 message convos, 10 min for 3-4 message convos
- Ready for background task integration
